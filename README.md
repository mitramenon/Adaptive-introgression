# Adaptive-introgression

Contains scripts used in: 
Adaptive evolution in a conifer hybrid zone is driven by a mosaic of recently introgressed and background genetic variants.

The goal through all these analyses is to determine the degree to which introgression contributes to adaptive evolution in range margin populations.
The code are currently set up to work well for my data format and these are available from Figshare as a part of the manuscript. If you have questions about the usage please contact me.
